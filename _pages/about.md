Hello, I am Vineeth Dorna, an enthusiastic incoming master's student at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu/about/about-umass-computer-science), pursuing a degree in Computer Science. My passion lies in the exciting field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly within the neural search domain. I am deeply intrigued by the potential of NLP in transforming the way we interact with information and enhance search capabilities. I aspire to contribute to cutting-edge research and innovations in this field to make search engines smarter and more intuitive.

Alongside my NLP fascination, I'm captivated by the possibilities of Generative AI. My journey involves delving into the intricacies of Language Models (LMMs) and their real-world problem-solving applications. At [KnowDis.AI](https://knowdis.ai/) & [Molecule.AI](https://moleculeai.com/), I've been an active participant in projects that revolve around Drug Discovery. These experiences allow me to apply my expertise towards overcoming pivotal challenges in the pharmaceutical landscape, contributing to groundbreaking advancements in medical research through the lens of generative models.

My undergraduate years were marked by an immersive opportunity to work within a semi-supervised framework, guided by [Professor Ganesh Ramakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh/). This exposure enriched my understanding of human-interpretable heuristics, unveiling the pragmatic applications of AI and its potential to tackle intricate problems in a manner that's comprehensible and empathetic to human understanding.
