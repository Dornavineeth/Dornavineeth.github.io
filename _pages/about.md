Hello, I am Vineeth Dorna, an enthusiastic incoming master's student at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu/about/about-umass-computer-science), pursuing a degree in Computer Science. My passion lies in the exciting field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly within the neural search domain. I am deeply intrigued by the potential of NLP in transforming the way we interact with information and enhance search capabilities. I aspire to contribute to cutting-edge research and innovations in this field to make search engines smarter and more intuitive.

In addition to my interest in NLP, I am also captivated by the world of Generative AI. I am keen on exploring Language Models (LLMS) and their applications to solve real-world problems. At knowdis.ai, I have been involved in stimulating projects focused on Drug discovery. This has allowed me to apply my skills and knowledge to tackle critical challenges in the pharmaceutical industry and contribute to advancements in medical research.

During my undergraduate years, I had the privilege of working in a semi-supervised setting under the guidance of [Professor Ganesh Ramakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh/). This experience was invaluable as it exposed me to the fascinating realm of human-interpretable heuristics. Working on this project helped me develop a deeper understanding of the practical applications of AI and its potential to solve complex problems in a more interpretable and human-friendly manner.
