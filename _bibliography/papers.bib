    abstract = "We present SPEAR, an open-source python library for data programming with semi supervision. The package implements several recent data programming approaches including facility to programmatically label and build training data. SPEAR facilitates weak supervision in the form of heuristics (or rules) and association of noisy labels to the training dataset. These noisy labels are aggregated to assign labels to the unlabeled data for downstream tasks. We have implemented several label aggregation approaches that aggregate the noisy labels and then train using the noisily labeled set in a cascaded manner. Our implementation also includes other approaches that jointly aggregate and train the model for text classification tasks. Thus, in our python package, we integrate several cascade and joint data-programming approaches while also providing the facility of data programming by letting the user define labeling functions or rules. The code and tutorial notebooks are available at https://github.com/decile-team/spear. Further, extensive documentation can be found at https://spear-decile.readthedocs.io/. Video tutorials demonstrating the usage of our package are available https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW8agt{\_}HvkVnOJoJAqBpaerFb-z-ZlqlP. We also present some real-world use cases of SPEAR.",

abstract = {Sketching is a visual thinking tool available to humans for several decades. With the advent of modern sketching technologies, artists use sketches to express and iterate their ideas. To accelerate sketch-based ideation and illustration workflows, we propose a novel framework, SketchBuddy, which retrieves diverse fine-grained object suggestions to enrich a sketch and coherently inserts it into the scene. Sketchbuddy detects objects in the input sketch to estimate the scene context which is then utilized for the recommendation and insertion. We propose a novel multi-modal transformer based framework for obtaining context-aware fine-grained object recommendations. We train a CNN-based bounding box classifier to extract information from the input scene and the recommended objects to infer plausible locations for insertion. While prior works focus on sketches at object-level only, SketchBuddy is the first work in the direction of scene-level sketching assistance. Our extensive evaluations comparing SketchBuddy against competing baselines across several metrics and agreements with human preferences demonstrate its value on several aspects.},
